# From Context API to Recoil JS in React

Resources and links associated with my talk on Recoil JS.

## Run this branch

Install Couchbase [single node, preferably with Docker](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/getting-started-docker.html) and install the `travel-sample` Sample Bucket. You may need to change the `server/server.js` file to add the database user and password that you choose during setup.

Once your database is running:

```
npm i && npm start
```
